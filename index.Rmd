# Introduction

## The problem setting

I order to design quantum algorithms we need to know how to execute
functions on a quantum computer. In particular, we are interested in
functions that take a (binary) number, and output a truth value (i.e.,
\({0, 1}\). That is, functions of the form \(f : {0, 1}n â†’ {0, 1}\)

Let us consider the following problem: There is a univariate function $f$, defined over the binary alphabet $0,1,$ with output range in the same alphabet $0,1$. I.e., $f:\{0,1\}\rightarrow \{0,1\}$.


We are given a function:
 \[f : \{0,1\} \to \{0,1\}\]
 Our goal is to determine whether $f$ is:
- Constant: $f (0) = f(1)$ (same output for both inputs) 
- Balanced: $f (0)= f(1) $(different outputs for each input)

#  Shorâ€™s Algorithm
![Peter Williston Shor (Resource: Wikipiedia ) ](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Peter_Shor_2017_Dirac_Medal_Award_Ceremony.png/330px-Peter_Shor_2017_Dirac_Medal_Award_Ceremony.png)

Shor's algorithm factorises a number $N$ in $\mathcal{O}((\log N)^3)$ time and $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ space. This algorithm was devised by Peter Shor in 1994.

This algorithm revolutionised the field of computing, as prime factoring has no polynomial time classical algorithm. An implication was that RSA cryptosystems, which use prime factoring as a key ingredient, would not be safe in the future, with the advent of large quantum computers.

Given an integer $N$, Shor's algorithm is about finding $b$ such that $b^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{N}$.

This idea can be formalised as follows:

> **Result**\
> Suppose $b^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{N}$ and $b \not\equiv \pm 1 \pmod{N}$. Then
\(\gcd(b + 1, N)\) and \(\gcd(b - 1, N)\) are non-trivial factors of $N$.

```{proof}
(_Proof Idea_)\
We are going to use proof by contraditction.
Let $d = \gcd(b - 1, N)$. Then $d$ is a divisor of $N$.

- If $d = N$, then $N \mid (b - 1)$ (contradiction).
- If $d = 1$, then there exist integers $k_1, k_2$ such that:
  \[
  \begin{eqnarray}
  (b - 1)k_1 + Nk_2 &=& 1\\
  (b + 1)(b - 1)k_1 + N(b + 1)k_2 &=& b + 1\\
  (b^2 - 1)k_1 + N(b + 1)k_2 &=& b + 1\\
  \frac{(b^2 - 1)}{N}k_1 + (b + 1)k_2 &=& \frac{b + 1}{N}
  \end{eqnarray}
  \]
  
  
  Since $N|(b-1)$, then \(\frac{(b^2 - 1)}{N}k_1\) is an integer, and \((b+1)k_2\), implies \(\frac{b + 1}{N}\) is an integer.
  This a contrdiction.

```{theorem,name='Eulers Theorem'}
Let $\alpha$ be an integer ($\alpha < N$) such that $\gcd(\alpha, N) = 1$. Then there exists some $s$ ($1 < s < N$) such that:
\[
\alpha^s \equiv 1 \pmod{N}.
\]
